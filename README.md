Hi, I'm Duvan Mendoza 🌟
I'm currently a master's student in Software Engineering and Big Data at the National Research Nuclear University MEPhI.

I have a strong passion for full-stack web development👨‍💻 and artificial intelligence🤖. I'm currently honing my skills in ⚛React.js, 🟢Django, 🟠and AWS, while diving deeper into the exciting world of ⚙machine learning, focusing on tools like Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow.

🎯 Career Objective:
My goal is to become a full-stack developer with expertise in Django, React, and Machine Learning—similar to a machine learning engineer. I firmly believe that anyone can learn to program with perseverance and dedication.
